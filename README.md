# Memory Dump Pattern Extractor

## Introduction

The Memory Dump Pattern Extractor script scans a memory dump file for email addresses and URLs using regular expressions. It reads the file in chunks, extracts matching patterns, and writes the found emails and URLs to separate output files. The script handles potential errors, such as file not found, and reports the success of the operation.

## Features

- **Pattern Matching**: Extracts email addresses and URLs from memory dump files.
- **Chunk Processing**: Reads large files in manageable chunks to avoid memory issues.
- **Output to Files**: Writes found emails and URLs to separate output files.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles file not found and other exceptions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher.

## Modules

- **re**: Provides functions for regular expression matching.
- **os**: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system and file paths.

```python
import re
import os
```

## Patterns

### Email Pattern

The regular expression used to match email addresses:

```python
email_pattern = re.compile(b'[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}')
```

### URL Pattern

The regular expression used to match URLs:

```python
url_pattern = re.compile(b'\w+:\/\/[\w@][\w.:@]+\/?[\w.\.?=%&=\-@$,]*')
```

## Functions

### `find_patterns_in_chunks(file_path, pattern)`

Finds patterns in file chunks.

- **Parameters:**
  - `file_path` (str): The path to the file.
  - `pattern` (re.Pattern): The compiled regular expression pattern.
- **Returns:**
  - `set`: A set of found items.

#### Example

```python
def find_patterns_in_chunks(file_path, pattern):
    chunk_size = 1024 * 1024  # 1MB
    found_items = set()
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        while True:
            chunk = file.read(chunk_size)
            if not chunk:
                break
            for item in pattern.findall(chunk):
                found_items.add(item.decode('utf-8'))
    return found_items
```

### `write_to_file(file_path, items)`

Writes found items to a file.

- **Parameters:**
  - `file_path` (str): The path to the output file.
  - `items` (set): The set of items to write.
- **Returns:**
  - `None`

#### Example

```python
def write_to_file(file_path, items):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        for item in sorted(items):
            f.write(item + '\n')
```

### `main()`

Orchestrates the pattern finding and file writing.

- **Returns:**
  - `None`

#### Example

```python
def main():
    memory_dump_path = r'path_to_your_memory_dump_file'
    output_emails_path = "found_emails.txt"
    output_urls_path = "found_urls.txt"
    try:
        found_emails = find_patterns_in_chunks(memory_dump_path, email_pattern)
        found_urls = find_patterns_in_chunks(memory_dump_path, url_pattern)
        write_to_file(output_emails_path, found_emails)
        write_to_file(output_urls_path, found_urls)
        print(f"Found emails and URLs have been written to '{output_emails_path}' and '{output_urls_path}' respectively.")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file {memory_dump_path} was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Usage

1. **Set the Memory Dump Path**: Replace the `memory_dump_path` variable in the `main()` function with the path to your memory dump file.

    ```python
    memory_dump_path = r'path_to_your_memory_dump_file'
    ```

    **Note**: Make sure to replace `"path_to_your_memory_dump_file"` with the actual path to the memory dump file on your system that you want to scan.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in your Python environment.

    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```

3. **Output**: The script will create two files, `found_emails.txt` and `found_urls.txt`, containing the extracted emails and URLs, respectively.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Found emails and URLs have been written to 'found_emails.txt' and 'found_urls.txt' respectively.
```

## Error Handling

- **File Not Found**: If the specified memory dump file is not found, an error message is displayed.
- **Unexpected Errors**: Any other exceptions are caught and a generic error message is displayed.

```plaintext
Error: The file path_to_your_memory_dump_file was not found.
An unexpected error occurred: <error_message>
```

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: Ensure the file path provided does not contain sensitive or unauthorized information.
- **Permission Handling**: Make sure the script has appropriate permissions to read the specified memory dump file.

## FAQs

**Q: What happens if the memory dump file is empty?**
A: The script will simply create empty output files for emails and URLs.

**Q: Can the script process large memory dump files?**
A: Yes, the script reads the file in 1MB chunks, making it efficient for large files.

**Q: How does the script handle different file types?**
A: The script is designed to process binary memory dump files.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid File Path**: Ensure that the file path is correct and accessible.
- **Module Not Found Errors**: Make sure Python is installed correctly and all necessary modules are available.
